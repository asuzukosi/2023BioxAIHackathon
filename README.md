# Biology Experiments Orchestrator

## Overview

The Biology Experiments Orchestrator is a project designed to streamline and automate biology experiments through the coordination of specialized research agents. These agents cover various aspects of the experimental process, including image analysis, experiment generation, execution, and information retrieval. Additionally, the system facilitates continuous improvement by periodically gathering feedback from users.

## Agents

### 1. Image Analysis Agent

- Responsible for analyzing images obtained during experiments.
- Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to extract relevant information.
- Generates detailed reports on image analysis results.

### 2. Experiment Generation Agent

- Creates experimental protocols based on specified parameters.
- Considers input from users and ensures protocols align with research objectives.
- Supports the generation of diverse and customizable experiments.

### 3. Experiment Execution Agent

- Executes experiments based on generated protocols.
- Coordinates with lab equipment and monitors real-time data acquisition.
- Ensures proper adherence to experimental timelines.

### 4. Information Retrieval Agent

- Retrieves and organizes experimental data from various sources.
- Provides a centralized repository for easy access to experiment results.
- Supports data querying and reporting functionalities.

### User Feedback Mechanism

- Periodically collects feedback from users to enhance system performance.
- Incorporates user suggestions to improve agent functionalities.
- Maintains a feedback loop to iteratively refine the overall user experience.

## Usage

1. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust agent parameters and configurations based on experimental requirements.

2. **Experiment Setup:**
   - Use the Experiment Generation Agent to create customized experimental protocols.

3. **Execution:**
   - Deploy the Experiment Execution Agent to carry out the experiments in the laboratory.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Leverage the Image Analysis Agent to process and analyze acquired experimental data.

5. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Utilize the Information Retrieval Agent to access and retrieve experiment results.

6. **Feedback:**
   - Provide feedback through the designated channels to improve system performance.
